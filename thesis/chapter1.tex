	% The three lines above not needed with our current style sheet.
	% Sometimes, such things are done to make sure that the headers are right, that the intro gets included in the table of contents, and that it doesn't get numbered 1 so that chapter one is 1.

The ability to write a thesis depends on putting one word after another.
Once you have managed that, you just have to keep repeating it.
You probably should continue until you are exhaused or done.

Sometimes, you want to cite documents to acknowledge ideas 
or to share the blame.  I am citing something here\cite{Levin:2007}.  
Here I want to give credit to many\cite{Levin:2007, Tran:2005, Ziegler:1991}.
When you put several items in the same cite, put them in the order 
they should appear, which is alphabetical (or numeric) order for most styles.
Now I have no more to say in this paragraph.

Other paragraphs would be boring too.
Therefore, it is now time to include a picture.  
The picture is shown in Figure \ref{PrettyPicture}.

\begin{figure}[tb]
% the options are h = here, t = top, b = bottom, p = page of figures.
% you can add an exclamation mark to make it try harder, and multiple
% options if you have an order of preference, e.g.
% \begin{figure}[h!tbp]
    \centering
    % DO NOT ADD A FILENAME EXTENSION TO THE GRAPHIC FILE; HERE THE FILE IS prettyfile.png
    \includegraphics[scale=0.90]{prettyfile}
    \caption{Pretty picture \cite{Levin:2007} }
    \label{PrettyPicture}
\end{figure}
	
This may not be the correct reference for this picture, so
don't keep this reference in your thesis.

\section{Specific Problem}
\label{SpecificProblem}

\indent 
This is a subsection of chapter 1.  It could be really interesting.
But it isn't.

\section{Motivation}
\label{Motivation}

\indent  This is a second subsection of the thesis.
It is about motivation.

It also has a figure (see Figure \ref{OtherPicture}).

\begin{figure}[tb]
\centering
% DO NOT ADD A FILENAME EXTENSION TO THE GRAPHIC FILE; here otherfile.png is included
\includegraphics{otherfile}
\caption{Other Figure for My Thesis}
\label{OtherPicture}
\end{figure}


I could write more words here but I am too tired.

\section{Structure of the Remainder of the Thesis}
\label{StructureOfTheRemainderOfTheThesis}
	
\indent 
Chapter 2 presents something.

In Chapter 3, more things are explained.

In Chapter 4, I run out of words.

Finally a summary, a conclusion, and suggestions for future work are presented in Chapter 5.  
Appendix A provides a more detailed explanation of nothing.  Appendix B gives even
less information than Appendix A.
