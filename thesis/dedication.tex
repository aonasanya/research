\textbf{\large Dedication}
\end{center}
This dissertation is dedicated to my beloved wife, Folasade, and our three wonderful children -- Tami, Teni, and Teju for their constant love and encouragement in the course of the Ph.D. program, despite all that happened prior to the commencement of the program. Everyone has been so supportive. What else can I expect from you all?

Last but not least, I also dedicate this dissertation to my parents (both of blessed memory) for your mentorship, provision, and support in my overall academic pursuit from inception. I still miss you both!
